## In two minutes

Three families — "Cartoon style illustration.", "Oil painting.", "Photograph." — each followed
by the same six subjects: a blacksmith, a rally car, a fox, a still life, a fisherman, a
lighthouse. Two seeds each. Eleven edits: five late blocks at my calibrated doses, a combined
preset of four of them at lower doses, block 9 as a pre-declared control, and four middle
blocks added at my request before any render.

![The combined late-block preset gives the six cartoon subjects the same flatter, brighter, more saturated look, and changes the oil and photo families in their own, weaker ways.](assets/23-prompt-family-presets/F23.1_family_sheet_combo.webp)

Read the cartoon columns first: six different subjects and one recognisable change — flatter
fills, brighter colour, cleaner outlines. In the oil and photo columns the same preset does
something milder, and different from what it does to cartoons.

## The verdict

Late-block presets are coherent inside a family: on all six tested arms the change is more alike
across the subjects of one family than across families, and inside a family it keeps about 70%
of the agreement it has across two seeds of one prompt. Coherence is strongest on cartoon and
weakest on photographs. Middle blocks give a common change that I see and no measure here
records, and block 9 can change a subject's identity. At these doses the late blocks cost
visible noise; "clean it up afterwards" was not tested.

## Why I might be wrong

* **"Coherent" means the same direction of change, measured on 23 style statistics.** Not
  identical results, and not a measure of how good the look is.
* **Three families, six subjects, two seeds.** Other styles, especially other photographic ones,
  may behave differently.
* **The by-family split was computed after the test.** The ranking cartoon > oil > photo is
  descriptive.
* **The eye pass is mine and not blind** (page 20). It was deposited before the numbers, and
  all images are published.
* **The combo is one example**, not an optimised preset.

## The data

### Coherence inside a family

For each arm, each image's change from its own baseline is a vector of 23 standardised style
features. W is the mean cosine between the changes of different subjects in the same family; B
between prompts of different families; S between the two seeds of one prompt (the ceiling).

![Every arm is more coherent within a family than between families; for the late blocks the gap is large and coherence reaches about 70 percent of the coherence across seeds.](assets/23-prompt-family-presets/F23.4_family_w_b_s.webp)

| rule | threshold | result | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 the family matters | W > B on ≥ 5 of 6, median W − B ≥ 0.10 | 6 of 6, **+0.19** | supported |
| H2 coherence is usable | median W ≥ 0.40 | **0.53** | supported |
| H3 blk09 + below the tested median | W < 0.53 | **0.16** | supported |
| H4 the Style band is less coherent | median W < 0.53 − 0.10 | **0.16** | supported |

The combo: W 0.53, B 0.26, S 0.75 (`data/prompt_family_test.csv`, `data/prompt_family_arms.csv`).

### Family by family

![Late-block presets are coherent across subjects inside a family, most on cartoon (up to 0.80) and least on photographs; middle blocks stay near 0.2 everywhere.](assets/23-prompt-family-presets/F23.3_family_coherence_by_family.webp)

| arm | cartoon | oil | photo | eye: common look? (cartoon / oil / photo) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| blk16 +0.30 | 0.79 | 0.34 | 0.14 | yes / yes / partly |
| blk20 +0.45 | 0.80 | 0.55 | 0.29 | yes / yes / **no** |
| blk23 −0.30 | 0.55 | 0.28 | 0.12 | yes / yes / **no** |
| blk26 +0.15 | 0.65 | 0.71 | 0.53 | yes / yes / yes |
| blk27 −0.25 | 0.56 | 0.59 | 0.42 | yes / yes / yes |
| combo | 0.76 | 0.36 | 0.48 | yes / yes / yes |

Where I saw no common look, the numbers are among the lowest. This agrees with what the
exploratory benches kept suggesting: photographic style is the hardest to steer.

### The middle blocks: the eye against the numbers

The four Style-band arms and the blk09 control sit at W 0.06–0.17, barely above B. My eye pass
said the opposite in most cells: a common, recognisable change in 8 of 12 Style-band cells and in
2 of 3 blk09 cells. What I wrote down is a change of content: blk09 + "raises realism coherently
in all", and on photographs it "idealises instead of making more realistic"; blk17 + reads as
"focus on the subject". In the sheet below (seed 5772156) the cartoon rally car becomes a
three-dimensional render.

![Block 9 pushed positive makes the cartoon subjects more three-dimensional and realistic and rearranges the scenes, a change of content more than of rendering.](assets/23-prompt-family-presets/F23.2_family_sheet_blk09.webp)

The 23 style features measure how a picture is rendered — texture, edges, colour. H3 and H4 are
supported as statements about rendering statistics; they do not show that middle blocks lack a
family-coherent effect, only that their effect is not a rendering effect. The obvious candidate
for a content measure, DINOv2, was tried with a pre-registered threshold and failed (page 25):
"more realistic" points in a different direction for a fox and for a car in a content embedding.
The middle blocks' coherence remains an observation by eye.

### A change of identity

![Under blk09 +0.45 the female blacksmith stays a woman at seed 5772156 in all three styles, and at seed 1414213 turns into a man in the oil painting and in the photograph.](assets/23-prompt-family-presets/F23.5_blacksmith_identity.webp)

At seed 1414213 blk09 + turns the female blacksmith into a man in the oil and photo families;
at seed 5772156 — the seed of the sheet above — she stays a woman in all three. In the cartoon
family the same edit turns the drawing into a three-dimensional render and keeps the woman. The edit moves
the picture toward the more common reading of the words: "blacksmith" toward a man. CLIPScore on
the six blacksmith prompts falls by 3.8 under blk09 +, the largest drop of any arm
(`data/standard_metrics_summary.csv`). One subject, two seeds: this is an observation with a
number that agrees, not a test.

### The cost

By eye, blk26 +0.15 and blk27 −0.25 are not acceptable in any family — a uniform patina of noise
— and the combo is acceptable only in part in two families. BRISQUE agrees on blk27 and the combo
(+9.6) and does not see blk26 (+0.4, page 25). The doses I had calibrated on single images are
too strong for a preset applied across a family. Whether a clean-up pass can remove the cost
without removing the look is untested.

### Against an earlier overturned result

[Notebook page 09](https://github.com/aledelpho/diffusion-models-weight-steering-report/blob/4f89b6404b1df4aa2e136ff6e7b6a74a4b79be37/notebook/09-style-direction.md) tested, with criteria frozen in advance,
whether the direction a weight edit imprints depends on the declared style more than on the
subject, and it was overturned: at the usable dose 6 of 12 cells carried the opposite sign. This
page finds that, for single late blocks, the change is more alike within a style than across
styles. The two are not the same experiment — a calibrated whole-stack preset and block
derangements there, single late blocks here; eight styles sharing one scene there, three styles
crossed with six subjects here — and this page does not claim to reconcile them. A reader should
keep both.

### An open question: middle blocks for a series of assets

Middle blocks are the ones I find most valuable: they change the picture more deeply than a
retouch could, which is what a series of assets with a fixed prompt structure and style would
want. What the data say so far: a deeper change at no measured quality cost (page 25); a common
change inside a family, seen by eye only; but the least predictable blocks, able to change a
subject's identity — a risk for a series whose characters must stay the same. The test that would
decide it (C51, not run): fixed characters across poses and scenes in one style, with a
middle-block preset on and off; does the identity hold?
