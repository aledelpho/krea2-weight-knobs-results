## In two minutes

Two subjects — an elf brawler in a comic style, a woman asleep in a canoe on a lotus pond — each
written four ways with the same facts (original, reordered, a pure tag list, prose with
synonyms), plus one version with a single object changed (the elf's gauntlet; the sleeper turned
into an old bearded man). Twelve blocks in both directions, two seeds.

![Block 19 pushed positive makes the same change to the elf under all four writings of the prompt and after the gauntlet is changed: the antlers shrink and the pauldron turns to fur.](assets/24-wording/F24.1_wording_sheet.webp)

The baselines differ from row to row: each writing gives a different pose and framing. The edit
does not: under every writing and after the gauntlet change, blk19 + turns the gold pauldron into
a straw-like fur, and the antlers shrink or disappear in most frames.

## The verdict

By eye the claim holds on every arm: same change across the four writings and after the content
change. By the numbers, writing behaves like the seed and the subject dominates. The registered
verdict is inconclusive, not supported, because its third condition failed on all twelve arms:
changing one object in the prompt disturbed a block's effect less than rewriting it. Stated
plainly: the text's structure matters about as much as the seed, less than the subject, and more
than a one-object change of content.

## Why I might be wrong

* **Two subjects, one seed pair.** On the canoe the arms are about half as strong as on the elf,
  and only 12 of 24 arms are larger than what rewriting alone does to the baseline.
* **The style features are partly sensitive to layout.** How close two edits look depends partly
  on how close the two pictures were to start with; the one-object change kept the layout best,
  which favours it. This does not explain the subject result.
* **The canoe content change kept two words of the original.** The "old bearded man" prompt
  still reads "one arm bends above her head … across her torso", a leftover of the edit.
* **The eye pass is mine and not blind** (page 20).

## The data

### How it was measured

Each image is reduced to 23 style features; an arm's effect on a prompt is its vector of feature
changes from the same prompt's baseline. A is the mean cosine between two such vectors:
A_writing across writings of the same subject, A_seed across seeds, A_content_small between the
original and the one-object change, A_subject between the two subjects. Only arms whose change is
larger than what rewriting does to the baseline (size > 1.15) are scored.

![A block's change is as consistent across writings of the prompt as across seeds, more consistent after a one-object content change, and much less consistent across subjects.](assets/24-wording/F24.2_wording_consistency.webp)

### The registered rule

| condition | needed | result | |
|---|---|---|---|
| median (A_writing − A_seed) | ≥ −0.10 | **−0.04** | met |
| A_writing > A_subject | ≥ 75% of arms | **12 of 12** | met |
| A_writing > A_content_small | ≥ 60% of arms | **0 of 12** | not met |

Scored arms: blk00 ±, blk09 −, blk12 +, blk13 +, blk15 +, blk17 ±, blk19 +, blk23 +, blk27 ±. On
them A_writing runs 0.53–0.92 and A_subject −0.15 to 0.52: what the picture contains decides what
a block does to it. A tag list against the original behaves like the other rewrites. The third
condition failed because the one-object change kept the picture (layout r of its baseline with
the original 0.68–0.76) while rewriting moved pose and framing (0.48–0.76). The design assumed the
opposite ordering. The same ordering appears in DINOv2 space (page 25): A_content_small 0.29 >
A_seed 0.22 > A_writing 0.16 ≫ A_subject 0.02.

### Word order

Before C45, an exploratory bench rendered one prompt in five word orders, two seeds, 56 arms.
By eye, blk19 + shrinks or removes the antlers and turns the pauldron to fur in 10 of 10 renders,
blk26 + lays the same mosaic of colour cells over the frame in 10 of 10, and blk17 + slims the
collar and simplifies the figure in 5 of 5 orders at one seed. With the same features:
consistency across orders tracks consistency across seeds (r = 0.92 over 56 arms) and is on
average 0.06 higher. Every arm with low consistency is among those whose change is smaller than
the reordering itself. The order does change the picture — baselines differ by ΔE 16–31, as much
as most edits — but it changes the frame, not the character, and not what a block does to it.
