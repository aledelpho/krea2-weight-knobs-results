## In two minutes

These edits are not single-block scaling. A block derangement swaps the weights of whole blocks
with one another, scaled by a dose; a permutation reorders them; a sign scramble flips signs so
that the weights move exactly as far without any structure. They are reported here because two
of their results are pre-registered and replicated, and because one of them tells something about
what a weight edit can bring into a picture. The full pages, with figures, data and
reproducibility blocks, are in the exploratory notebook.

## The verdict

Block derangement has two confirmed effects: the sign of the edit decides whether hatching strokes
cross or run parallel (16 of 16 prompts), and the edit enlarges the subject in the frame (9 of 10
new styles). A permutation brought out an attribute the prompt asked for and the model usually
leaves out, in 19 of 20 seeds; it is an observation, not a result, and is boxed as such below.

## Why I might be wrong

* **These are a different family of edits** from the rest of the report. Nothing here says
  anything about single blocks.
* **The hatching measure was not checked against the calibrated preset**, which moves it the
  other way; for that preset the measure may not track hatching at all (notebook page 06).
* **The enlargement may be a matter of size, not structure.** The scramble at equal distance was
  not rendered.
* **The attribute observation was scored by me, with the condition visible,** on one prompt family.

## The data

### The hatching axis

In a comic-style corpus, block derangement pushed positive crossed the hatching strokes and pushed
negative ran them parallel. A pre-registered test on 16 new prompts confirmed the sign: crosshatch
entropy +0.288, 16 of 16 prompts, 79 of 80 pairs. The same test overturned the third family of the
prediction — the sign scramble's exploratory effect did not come back (5 of 16 prompts). Full page:
[notebook page 06](https://github.com/aledelpho/diffusion-models-weight-steering-report/blob/73bbfd1ca3be284fa1494cf760863e988a1fb936/notebook/06-the-hatching-axis.md).

### The subject grows

Pre-registered on ten styles that did not exist when the prediction was frozen: under block
derangement at double dose the subject's area grows by a geometric mean of 1.234, in 9 of 10
styles, with all three predicted signs correct. The same round measured the blinding of the eye
pass and found it failed ([page 20](20-method.md#why-the-eye-pass-is-declared-open)). Full page:

### A curiosity: attributes that appear

> **Observed, not established.** A prompt asked for "small barnacle-like clusters studding one
> earlobe". The stock model drew them in 1 of 20 seeds; a block permutation drew them in 19 of 20;
> a sign scramble moving the weights exactly as far (D = 0.0538) drew them in 1 of 20. On a
> separate corpus — a rally car in a jungle, eight drawing styles, no lights named in the prompt —
> lit headlights went from 10 of 35 at baseline to 31 of 38 under one edit and to 0 of 39 under
> another.
>
> **Its weaknesses.** A different kind of edit from the rest of this report. The barnacle round
> was scored by me with the condition visible. The headlights were scored blind, but on the very
> renders that produced the observation; the exact test is at its floor (p = 0.031, Holm 0.19).
> The pre-registered confirmation on a second corpus could not decide anything: 9 of its 10
> prompts never lit a headlight in any condition. One prompt family; the test of generality was
> designed and never run.

What makes it worth keeping is the control: the same distance in weight space, without structure,
does nothing. How the weights move mattered, not how far. Full page:
