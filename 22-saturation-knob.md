## In two minutes

Krea-2 has 28 transformer blocks. Multiplying the weights of block 23 by a little more than
one lowers the saturation of the picture; by a little less than one, raises it. I rendered
eight prompts — a cartoon elf, an oil-painted elf, a sepia photograph, a rally car, a fox, a
still life, an archer, a selfie — at two seeds each, along a ladder of five doses, and next to
the same prompts with "colorful, vivid highly saturated colors" or "muted colors, desaturated,
low saturation" added to the text.

![On all eight prompts blk23 moves colour the expected way at every rung, while the words "colorful" redraw the cartoon elf and add a cut lemon and a new composition to the still life; under each panel, the measured chroma change.](assets/22-saturation-knob/F22.1_saturation_ladder_sheet.webp)

Read the sheet by columns. Along the ladder the picture stays the same picture and only its
colour moves. The second column is what the words do: the cartoon elf turns blonde and is
redrawn, the still life gains a cut lemon and a pink table. The words do more — more colour and
more of everything else.

## The verdict

Block 23 is a saturation knob: monotone on 15 of 16 cells and roughly proportional to the dose.
At the same colour gain it disturbs the picture less than the words, on every standard metric
tried. It is a gentle knob — on 9 of 16 cells the words reach more colour than the block at its
strongest tested dose — and its desaturating side is weaker and less clean than its saturating
one.

## Why I might be wrong

* **One observer, not blind.** The eye pass is mine, and I knew which column was which. All 128
  images are published so anyone can look.
* **The matched comparison rests on 7 cells.** The pre-registration set no minimum number of
  scorable cells. Nine cells could not be compared because the words went beyond the ladder.
* **Measures of "the rest of the picture" are imperfect.** Layout r sees small shifts the eye
  does not call a change of content; LPIPS and DINOv2 agree with it here, but all three are
  coarse.
* **One wording per direction.** Other phrasings, or the words at the start of the prompt, may
  behave differently.
* **The desaturating side has side effects** I marked by eye on 8 of 16 cells: softening, and on
  the selfie a skin that turns greenish.

## The data

### How it was measured

Each image is compared with the baseline of the same prompt and seed in CIELAB at 64×80:
mean chroma change, and layout r, the correlation of the lightness channel with the baseline.
The words are matched to the ladder by linear interpolation of chroma between rungs; layout r,
LPIPS and DINOv2 cosine are interpolated at the same point.

### Direction and proportion

![On all eight prompts blk23 -0.45 adds colour and blk23 +0.30 removes it while the picture stays the same picture.](assets/22-saturation-knob/F22.4_blk23_everywhere.webp)

![Chroma change falls monotonically from blk23 -0.45 to +0.30 in 15 of 16 prompt-seed cells, with a median of +3.9 at -0.45 and -3.1 at +0.30.](assets/22-saturation-knob/F22.2_saturation_dose_response.webp)

| test | registered threshold | result |
|---|---|---|
| chroma falls strictly along the ladder | ≥ 14 of 16 | **15 of 16** |
| gain at -0.30 over gain at -0.15, median | 1.6 – 2.4 | **1.76** |

The one exception is the sepia photograph at seed 4669201, where +0.15 and +0.30 remove almost
the same colour (−1.62, −1.51). Before this bench, every render with a blk23 arm in the
repository — 83 images across five benches — already moved chroma the expected way
(`data/blk23_saturation_all.csv`).

### Against the words

![Where blk23 reaches the chroma gain of the words "colorful" (7 of 16 cells), it leaves the picture closer to the baseline: layout in 6 of 7, LPIPS in 7 of 7, DINOv2 in 6 of 7.](assets/22-saturation-knob/F22.3_matched_chroma_pairs.webp)

| | median over 16 cells | layout r |
|---|---|---|
| "colorful" | chroma +5.7 | 0.80 |
| blk23 −0.45 | chroma +3.9 | 0.87 |

In 9 of 16 cells the words add more colour than blk23 at −0.45; on the cartoon elf +9.8 against
+1.6. On the sepia photograph it runs the other way: blk23 +5.2, the words +2.2. My eye, asked
which of the two changed the content more with colour ignored, said the words in 9 of 16 cells,
blk23 in 2, equal in 5 (`data/blk23_colorful_eye_alessandro.csv`, deposited before the numbers).

No measured quality cost: BRISQUE moves by +0.9 for blk23 −0.45 and −0.95 for the words;
CLIP-IQA by at most 0.02 (`data/standard_metrics_summary.csv`).

### The controls

Every image of the 26 conditions that already existed on older benches at the original seed
was re-rendered and came out pixel-identical ([`docs/RENDERS_2026-10-04_blk23_colorful.md`](https://github.com/aledelpho/diffusion-models-weight-steering-report/blob/e20fcae6b9a191b25747aa15b68ab73a4c4052c6/docs/RENDERS_2026-10-04_blk23_colorful.md)).
